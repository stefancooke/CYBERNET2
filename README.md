<h2>Description</h2>
The software created for this project was split into two parts. Firstly the creation of a legitimate phishing website to demonstrate the need for anti-phishing measures such as CyberNet. This was made using a tool found on GitHub which was used in a Kali Linux environment, this tool was BlackEye and it was useful in demonstrating the dangers of phishing. Secondly an Android based app was created with this latest version on Android Studio. The languages used to make this were Java, and an XML markup language to create the layouts and app designs.
The aim of this project is to teach people and spread awareness about phishing attacks by creating a mobile app which teaches people about one of the biggest threats to cyber security (phishing attacks) and give them the resources required to better their knowledge and understanding of these threats.
